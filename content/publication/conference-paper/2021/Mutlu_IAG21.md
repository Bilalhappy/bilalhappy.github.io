abstract: In the last decades, a severe decrease of the glacial masses is observed in the Polar Regions due to the increasing effect of global warming. Continuous observations in these regions are required for quantifying the loss in the glacier mass and monitoring the increase in mean sea level. Besides, as a consequence of the glaciers mass loss, an uplift occurs (the post-glacial rebound (PGR) effect) in the affected areas and should be monitored as well. In this context, the geosensors including GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), satellite radar altimetry, Earth gravity satellite missions as well as the tide-gauges are widely used and contribute to studies of these dynamic phenomena. Within the scope of this study, the variations of the glacial mass within a time period in the Antarctic region are investigated using the geosensors data. Regarding this, the GNSS stations of the UNAVCO (University NAVSTAR Consortium) and IGS (International GNSS Service) networks data, the GRACE/GRACE-FO (The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) solutions, CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) satellite radar altimetry data in addition to the tide-gauge observations are used to carry out the analyzes through the generated time series. Thus, the mass loss in the study area is clarified from a broad perspective relying on the comparative results of different
geosensorsâ€™ data.
