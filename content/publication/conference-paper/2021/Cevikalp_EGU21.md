abstract: The maintenance of leveling benchmark is both laborious and costly due to distortions caused by geodynamic activities and local deformations. It is necessary to realize geoid-based vertical datum, which also enables calculation from ellipsoidal heights obtained from GNSS to orthometric heights that have physical meaning. It can be considered as an important step for height system unification as it eliminates the problems stem from the conventional vertical datum. The ongoing height modernization efforts in Turkey focus to improve quality and coverage of the gravity data, eliminate errors in existing terrestrial gravity measurements in order to achieve a precise geoid model. Accuracy of the geopotential model is crucial while realizing a geoid model based vertical datum as well as unifying the regional height systems with the International Heights Reference System. In this point of view, we assessed the accuracies of recently released global geopotential models including XGM2019e_2159, GECO, EIGEN-6C4, EGM2008, SGG-UGM-1, EIGEN-6C3stat, and EIGEN-6C2 using high order GNSS/leveling control benchmarks and terrestrial gravity data in Turkey. The reason for choosing these models in the validations is their relatively higher spatial resolutions and improved accuracies compared to other GGMs in published validation results with globally distributed terrestrial data. The GNSS/leveling data used in validations include high accuracy GNSS coordinates in ITRF datum with co-located Helmert orthometric heights in regional vertical datum. 100 benchmarks are homogeneously distributed in the country with the benchmarks along the coastlines. In addition, the terrestrial gravity anomalies with 5 arc-minute resolution were also used in the tests. In order to have comparable results, residual terrain effect has been restored to the GGM derived parameters. Numerical tests revealed significant differences in accuracies of the tested GGMs. The most accurate GGM has the comparable performance with official regional geoid model solutions in Turkey. The drawn results in the study were interpreted and discussed from practical applications and height system unification points in conclusion.
