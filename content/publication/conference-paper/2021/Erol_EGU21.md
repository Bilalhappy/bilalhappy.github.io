abstract: Because of the inclined-orbit of GNSS constellations that are not cover the Polar Regions, the polar gaps occur between certain latitudes and therefore in these regions the satellite observations are limited around the zenith direction. In addition, from summer to winter season, the daylight and weather conditions vary tremendously in the Polar Regions. In the context of this study, the PPP accuracy performance was tested as a function of winter and summer seasons, GPS-only and GPS&GLONASS constellations, PPP-AR and PPP-Float solution strategies, static and kinematic processing modes, varying occupation times (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h and daily), and increasing latitudes towards the South Pole at the OHI3, ROTH, MCM4, and AMU2 GNSS stations in the Antarctica continent. Besides, the effect of the ambiguity solution strategies and the used constellations in the process on PPP convergence time was also examined. In the assessment results of the study, it was revealed that the PPP-AR strategy, additional GLONASS system to GPS constellation, and increased occupation times improved the static and kinematic positioning accuracy. Besides, although similar accuracies were obtained in both seasons, the position accuracy was slightly better in winter. Regarding the investigation on convergence time, the PPP-AR solution using the GPS&GLONASS constellations improved the convergence time by 66% comparing to the GPS-only PPP-Float solution. Finally, according to the assessment of the PPP-AR accuracy performance depending on the increasing latitude towards the South Pole, it has been observed that the 2D position accuracy remained stable for three stations except for AMU2. Besides, the vertical position accuracy decreased as it approaches the South Pole and the GLONASS system contributed to the improvement of the accuracy.
