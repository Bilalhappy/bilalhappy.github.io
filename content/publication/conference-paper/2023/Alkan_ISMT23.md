abstract: As a result of advances in technologies, the raw GNSS measurement (i.e., pseudorange, phase, and Doppler) can now be collected with smartphones, tablet computers, and handheld GNSS receivers/chipsets. The most important milestone in this field was undoubtedly Google’s announcement in May 2016 that devices with Android Nougat v.7.x and higher operating systems can collect GNSS raw data. On the other hand, some manufacturers (like Garmin Ltd.) have allowed GNSS raw measurements to be recorded with handheld GNSS devices, which are mostly used for navigation, outdoor and sporting activities. This has paved the way for smartphones or handheld-type GNSS devices to be used as accurate 3D positioning systems in addition to their standard functions. In this study, the 3D positioning performance of the Garmin GPSMAP® 66sr handheld device using the raw measurements is presented. For this purpose, two static test measurements were made, one in a noisy environment without completely open sky visibility and having more multipath effects and the second one in relatively favorable environmental conditions. In these measurements, GPS (L1, L5), GLONASS (L1), and Galileo (E1, E5a) data were collected at 1-second intervals with a Garmin receiver, and the points were coordinated with the conventional relative method and PPP technique. In order to determine the effect of measurement time span on the accuracy performance, the data collected over a longer period were divided into sub-groups of 1-hour each and processed again using the same ways. The coordinates obtained from the Garmin receiver’s solutions were compared with those measured by the geodetic receiver. The overall results show that the handheld GNSS receivers achieved centimeter-level accuracy with the relative technique, while meter-level accuracy could be obtained with the PPP technique.
