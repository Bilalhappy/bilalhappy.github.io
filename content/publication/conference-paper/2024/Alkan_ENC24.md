abstract: As a result of developments in hardware and software technologies, the raw GNSS data can now be collected on different platforms, like smartphones, tablet computers and handheld receivers. In this study, the static and kinematic positioning performance of the Garmin GPSMAP 66sr handheld GNSS receiver has been tested. For the static test, GNSS data was collected for 24 hours on September 18-19, 2023. The collected daily dataset was divided into shorter sessions of 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours to assess the performance of the Garmin receiver as a function of occupation time. The whole and subgroup data were processed with the relative method by Topcon MAGNET Office software. Three continuously operating reference stations, i.e., ISTA, PALA and YALI, were used as reference control points to form a very short, short and relatively long baseline of about 45 meters, 5 km and 73 km, respectively. The coordinates obtained from each of the three different baseline solutions were compared with the known coordinates. For a realistic kinematic test, the data was collected by walking for approximately 1 hour in a stadium on campus on July 29, 2023, using the Garmin and geodetic-grade GNSS receivers that connected to the same measurement pole. The collected data from both receivers was processed with the relative method, and the calculated Garmin coordinates were compared with those calculated by the geodetic receiver. The whole and subgroup static and kinematic data of the Garmin receiver were processed again with the Canadian Spatial Reference System Precise Point Positioning (CSRS-PPP) online service and the obtained PPP solutions were compared with the known coordinates. The overall results show that the Garmin GPSMAP 66sr handheld receiver provides accuracy in the decimeter-to-centimeter range using the relative method when integer uncertainties were correctly resolved and, in the meter-to-centimeter range using the PPP technique.
