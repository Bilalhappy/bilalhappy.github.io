abstract: Water is one of the most important needs of human life and plays a very important role in maintaining a healthy life. Nowadays, because of reasons such as global warming, water resources are under threat. Hence, humanity may face such a problem as water scarcity. Therefore, continuous monitoring and control of the water resources is necessary and essential, but since water basins are very large areas, it is difficult and expensive to carry out these observations using ground-based measurements accurately. In addition, these analyses are possible using satellite gravimetry. The gravitational field of the Earth continuously changes depending on time, and the redistribution of the water reservoir, which makes up three quarters of the globe, play vital role for gravitational field of the Earth. The vertical variation of these water bodies distributions can be investigated using the GRACE satellite pair, launched in 2002 by NASA. There are 4 different types of GRACE data and several analysis centers that provide and evaluate these data. Based on these, the problems come into minds such as how to model GRACE data and which GRACE data product must be used for more precise analyses and predictions. In addition, the interfaces or applications in which this data will be compiled is a separate problem and will be considered in this study. In the study, the Euphrates / Tigris basin, which is located between 30o-40o north latitudes and 37o- 52o east longitude, is selected as the study area, and the Equivalent Water Thickness(EWT) based on these mass changes is calculated with GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite gravimetry data. The study was conducted in 3 different interfaces (applications); IGiK-TVGMF, EGSIEM Plotter and ICGEM. Common data set must be selected to investigate the differences between the results obtained in these different interfaces. In this context, Level-2 GRACE product with the DDK5 filtered was chosen, which was published by Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB).
